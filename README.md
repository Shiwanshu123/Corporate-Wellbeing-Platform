cd Corporate-Wellbeing-Platform
Project Structure: Your project should have the following structure:

Local Testing: The project uses basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. To test the project locally, follow these steps:

Open the index.html file in a browser.
Verify that the health tracking, mental wellness, and finance features are functioning properly.
Ensure that the data input and display for each section (health, mental wellness, finance) work as expected.
Deployment Instructions
Deploy to Netlify
To deploy your project on Netlify, follow these steps:

Push Code to GitHub: Make sure your latest changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.

bash
Copy code
git add .
git commit -m "Initial project setup"
git push origin main
Sign in to Netlify:

Go to Netlify and sign in (or create an account).
Create a New Site:

After logging in, click on the New site from Git button.
Choose GitHub as the Git provider.
Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub repositories and select the Corporate Wellbeing Platform repository.
Configure Deployment Settings:

Branch to deploy: main (or the branch you want to deploy).
Build command: Leave this empty (because it's a static site with no build process).
Publish directory: Set this to ./ (root directory) since all files are in the root of the project.
Deploy the Site: Click on Deploy Site to start the deployment process. Netlify will automatically build and deploy the project.

Confirm Deployment:

After deployment, Netlify will provide you with a unique URL (e.g., https://your-site-name.netlify.app).
Open the URL and ensure the website is functioning correctly.
Custom Domain (Optional)
If you'd like to use a custom domain, you can configure it within the Netlify dashboard:

Go to your site settings in Netlify.
Under Domain Management, click Add custom domain.
Follow the instructions to connect your domain.
Updates and Maintenance
To update the website, simply make changes to the code, commit them, and push to the GitHub repository.
Netlify will automatically deploy the new changes once they are pushed to the main branch.
